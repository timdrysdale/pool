# Pool


## Worker pools in golang

There are many. I tried this one from [this implementation by brandur](https://brandur.org/go-worker-pool). 

It's in a repo here because the github link was broken, and I scraped the code from the blog, then added some tests

Note this common mistake when dispatching ... [Using reference to loop iterator variable](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CommonMistakes)
